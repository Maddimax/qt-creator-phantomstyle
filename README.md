# Qt Creator PhantomStyle Plugin

This plugin will set the PhantomStyle QStyle for Qt Creator.

# Phantom Style

"Phantom is a QStyle for Qt which began as an overhaul of QFusionStyle. Similar to
Fusion, it's designed to be a looks-the-same cross-platform style. It looks native
to nobody, but familiar to many. It has the visual appearance of a traditional GUI,
and does not adopt a "modern flat" style. Compared to Fusion, it has many fixes,
objective improvements, and subjective improvements."

For details see the [phantomstyle](https://github.com/cristianadam/phantomstyle) 
project page.
